# SnowCode

This is Chad Palmer's senior project in Computer Science and Mathematics at Yale. I've implemented from scratch a new QR-like matrix barcode, which I have named SnowCode.

## Try it out!

A deployed version of the frontend Flask app can be found at <https://snowcode-chad.herokuapp.com/>.

## Installation

After pulling to your local device, run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `snowcode.py` module can be run in terminal with `python3 snowcode.py`, which provides a simple CLI for debugging.

The frontend Flask app can be launched by running `python3 -m flask run`.
